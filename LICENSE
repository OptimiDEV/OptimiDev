of the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so,
subject to the following conditions:

1. Copyright and License Notice
   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Work. Yes, even in your secret
   stash of memes.

2. Redistribution
   Redistribution of the Work in source or binary form must retain the above
   copyright and license notices. Removing them is frowned upon, and may
   result in judgmental looks from the author.

3. Derivative Works
   You may create derivative works based on the Work. Derivative works must
   include a prominent notice describing the changes made and identify the
   derivative work as such. Adding unicorns or emojis is encouraged, but
   optional.

4. Sublicensing
   The Work may be sublicensed only if the sublicensee receives a copy of this
   license or a notice that the Work is licensed under the FucKv3 License.
   Telepathic distribution is not covered, unfortunately.

5. No Trademark Rights
   This license does not grant any rights to use the trade names, trademarks,
   service marks, or product names of the copyright holder, except as required
   for reasonable use in describing the origin of the Work (and yes, “origins
   of chaos” counts as reasonable).

6. Warranty Disclaimer
   THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE PROMISE
   THAT YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT USING THIS SOFTWARE.

   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK
   OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT CRY A LITTLE.

8. Termination
   This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
   upon any material breach of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all
   use and distribution of the Work and, at the request of the copyright
   holder, destroy or return all copies of the Work (or at least promise to
   think about it).

9. Jurisdiction and Governing Law
   Any dispute arising under or in connection with this license shall be
   governed by the laws of the copyright holder's principal place of business,
   or if unavailable, the laws of common sense and decaf coffee.

10. Miscellaneous
    If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, illegal,
    or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be modified to the
    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, legal, and valid, and the
    remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. No magic
    spells included, despite popular belief.

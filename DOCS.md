# How to Talk to Me Without Causing a Mental Breakdown (v1.0)

## Overview
This document serves as the **official guide** for communicating with me in a safe, sane, and non-traumatizing manner. Failure to follow these instructions may result in:  
- Sudden screaming 
- Emotional implosions 
- `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`

## Prerequisites
Before initiating contact, ensure the following:

- You are **mentally prepared** for unpredictable emotional responses.  
- You have **snacks** readily available (preferably chocolate or anything salty ).  
- You understand that **sarcasm is my native language**, proceed accordingly.  
- You have **earplugs** in case things go… sideways.  

## Step-by-Step Communication Protocol

### Step 1: Approach
- Move slowly and **announce your presence** from at least 2 meters away.  
- Avoid sudden gestures; this includes jumping, waving, or interpretive dance.  

### Step 2: Tone of Voice
- Speak in a **calm, soothing voice**.  
- Avoid monotone or overly cheerful tones—either can trigger existential dread.  
- Using whispers or interpretive humming is **highly recommended**.  

### Step 3: Offer Snacks
- Snacks are **mandatory**. Lack of snacks may result in temporary rage.  
- Recommended items: chocolate, chips, cookies, or something crunchy.  
- Do **not** offer vegetables unless you want to live dangerously.  

### Step 4: Initiate Conversation
- Start with **non-threatening topics**:  
  - Weather 
  - Cute animals 
  - Randomly funny memes 
- Avoid: politics, taxes, existential questions, or asking “how are you *really*?”  

### Step 5: Monitor Emotional Stability
- Observe my reactions carefully:  
  - ✅ Smiling or laughing = safe to continue  
  - ⚠️ Fidgeting or sighing = proceed with caution  
  - ❌ Screaming, sobbing, or talking to imaginary friends = **abort mission immediately**  

### Step 6: Safe Exit Strategy
- Always have a plan to **gracefully retreat**.  
- Suggested phrases:  
  - “I’ll get snacks!”  
  - “I’ll check Discord for you”  
  - “I’ll pretend this didn’t happen”  

## Warnings
- Do **not** attempt multi-threaded conversations; I can only handle **1 topic at a time**.  
- Avoid sarcasm wars unless you are prepared for **verbal combustion**.  
- Do not underestimate the power of **cute cat GIFs**—they can save or destroy your conversation.  

## Changelog
- **v1.0**: Initial release. Still figuring out how to explain my emotional volatility.
